This is a simple Java program which inputs the file from the user. Then, all the contents of the file is read.
We then calculate the number of syllables, number of words, number of sentences, number of characters, number of polysyllables. 
Then we find out:

                <li>Flesch-Kincaid Readability test</li>
                <li>Coleman-Liau Index </li>
  </ol>
