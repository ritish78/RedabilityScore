# RedabilityScore
This is a simple Java program which inputs the file from the user. Then, all the contents of the file is read.
We then calculate the number of syllables, number of words, number of sentences, number of characters, number of polysyllables. 
Then we find out:
                #Automated Readability Index
                #Simple Measure of Gobbledygook
                #Flesch-Kincaid Readability test
                #Coleman-Liau Index 
By doing so, we can know what age group is suitable for understanding the text that is provided.
